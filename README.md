        <li><code>GET /api/Cliente/{id}</code>: Retrieve information about a specific customer by providing their ID.</li>
        <li><code>POST /api/Cliente</code>: Create a new customer entry by providing customer details such as name, CPF, email, etc.</li>
        <li><code>PUT /api/Cliente/{id}</code>: Update information for a specific customer, including customer details.</li>
        <li><code>DELETE /api/Cliente/{id}</code>: Delete a customer entry by providing their ID.</li>
